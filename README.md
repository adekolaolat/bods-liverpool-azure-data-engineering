# Azure Data Pipeline Public Buses in Liverpool City

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Azure data pipeline solution to collect public bus location in Liverpool using **Bus Open Data Service (BODS)** API service.


## About BODS

BODS has open data published by the operators of local bus and coach services across England which are timetable, location, fares and disruption data and this has been possible through The Bus Services Act 2017 that requires local bus operators in England to provide specific data between 2020 and 2021. 

The Bus Open Data Service offers free, license-free access to this information and allows users to give feedback to data publishers.


## Why do we need to store this data?

Currently, the Bus Open Data Service (BODS) only provides live data, meaning there is no historical record to analyze trends, identify recurring issues, or build predictive models. By collecting and storing historical bus tracking data, different authorities can analyze operational trends, predict potential delays, and improve service planning.


## Business Use Cases

- Transport Authorities & City Planning would need data to improve route planning, predict delays, and enhance public transport efficiency.

- Bus Operators can leverage insights from analysis of the historical data to benchmark performance and make strategic decisions to gain a competitive edge.  **Break Monoply !!**

- Help public transport users save money on tickets for routes with multiple operators, reduce travel time, and improve their commuting experience.
